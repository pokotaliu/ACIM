- Practice mode with 60-second guided timer
- Warm, elegant visual design reminiscent of an evening lecture hall
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Pure frontend - no backend required

## Tech Stack

- React 19
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- GitHub Pages deployment

## Design Philosophy

This is not a traditional reading page, but an immersive experience. Users should feel like they are:
- Sitting in the Temecula workshop
- Kenneth is slowly reading the text, then putting down the notes to explain
- There are pauses, rhythm, and layers gradually unfolding
